# Ied

[ied][] is built on a very similar premise. `pnpm` takes huge inspiration from ied.

Unlike ied, however:

- pnpm aims to achieve compatibility with npm utilities (eg, shrinkwrap), and so deviates from ied's store schema (see [ยง Design](#design)).
- pnpm has a different (but still very similar) store layout than ied.
