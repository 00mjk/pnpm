## 8.0.0

### Major Changes

- 16d1ac0fd: `body.cacheByEngine` removed from `PackageResponse`.
- da091c711: Remove state from store. The store should not store the information about what projects on the computer use what dependencies. This information was needed for pruning in pnpm v4. Also, without this information, we cannot have the `pnpm store usages` command. So `pnpm store usages` is deprecated.
- b6a82072e: Using a content-addressable filesystem for storing packages.
- 802d145fc: `getPackageLocation()` removed from store. Remove `inStoreLocation` from the result of `fetchPackage()`.
- a5febb913: The importPackage function of the store controller is importing packages directly from the side-effects cache.
- a5febb913: The upload function of the store controller accepts `opts.filesIndexFile` instead of `opts.packageId`.

### Minor Changes

- f516d266c: Executables are saved into a separate directory inside the content-addressable storage.
- 42e6490d1: The fetch package to store function does not need the pkgName anymore.
- a5febb913: Package request response contains the path to the files index file.
- a5febb913: sideEffects property added to files index file.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [da091c711]
  - @pnpm/types@6.0.0
  - @pnpm/resolver-base@7.0.1
